<h2>House Blend Cofffee</h2>

<p style="width: 46%;">The degree to which a coffee bean is roasted is one of the most important factors that determine the taste of the coffee. Unroasted beans (green in color) are put into a roaster and exposed to a high level of heat. When the bean “cracks,” it loses its outer coating and releases the flavor of the bean. The longer the bean roasts, the darker and stronger the bean becomes. When the roasting is complete, the beans can be blended and ground to create distinct flavors and brews.

    Since blends are not standardized, the various roasts of coffee are how we would refer to the various different types of bean categories, which are: light roast, medium roast, medium-dark roast, and dark roast. Light roast coffees will generally boast the most caffeine while maintaining a light color (and often lighter flavor). Medium roasts are medium brown in color and provide a more balanced flavor and aroma. Medium-dark roasts are a darker brown than the medium beans and boast a stronger and more full-bodied flavor than light and medium. Lastly, dark roasts are dark brown in color and will boast a bitter, smoky taste in the cup.
    
    Other things that factor in to the taste of coffee are the originating country in which the beans are harvested from and the processing techniques that are unique to those region. Also, coffee flavors and tastes can also vary distinctly dependent on how the bean is brewed into the cup  for example, cold press, drip, etc.
